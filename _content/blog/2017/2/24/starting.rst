The two main commands for rst blog
==================================

Once you have your first entry written, just a command is to parse it

>>> python manage.py build content

The next command will create a small webserver and run your web in `localhost:500 <http://localhost:5000>`_

>>> python manage.py serve content


That's all!

>>> BYE
