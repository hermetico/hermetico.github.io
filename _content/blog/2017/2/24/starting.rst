The two main commands for rstblog
==================================

Once you have your first entry written, just a command is to parse it, check that you have your config.yml at the root of the ``_content folder``.

>>> run-rstblog build _content

The next command will serve your web in `localhost:500 <http://localhost:5000>`_

>>> run-rstblog serve _content


That's all!

>>> BYE
