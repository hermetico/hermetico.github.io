Hi! I am Juan Marin, computer scientist and developer
======================================================

I am a graduate in Computer Science from the Universitat de Barcelona and a student of a Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Southern Denmark. I have worked as a full-stack web developer for almost 5 years in a small company in Barcelona, which gave me the opportunity to use my theoretical knowledge from the University to real world applications.

I have also made some collaborations with the research department of Computer vision of The University of Barcelona

As a student I loved learning new and different things every semester, not only from artificial intelligence and machine learning, which are the areas I am now more focused on, but also from other areas such as algorithm optimization, distributed systems or data structures. I am not afraid of changes and challenges, I think they keep me up-to-date and help me to sharp my skills.
